# Asteroids
Asteroids arcade game written in python. This game (when complete) will include a moveable spaceship whose objective is to dodge and destroy incoming asteroids, with each destroyed asteroid awarding you points.

In order to run, you must first have pygame installed: "Pygame (the library) is a Free and Open Source python programming language library for making multimedia applications like games built on top of the excellent SDL library. https://www.pygame.org"
(pip install pygame)
